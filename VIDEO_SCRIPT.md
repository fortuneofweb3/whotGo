**[SCREEN: Main menu with profile creation]**

"WhotGo uses the Honeycomb Protocol to create on-chain user profiles. When you first connect, the game automatically creates a permanent profile on Solana's blockchain. This profile stores your game statistics, achievements, and personal information - all verifiable and permanent."

**[ACTION: Show profile creation process]**

"Your profile includes custom data fields for game stats, achievement progress, and personal info. Unlike traditional games where your data lives on a server, here everything is stored on-chain through Honeycomb's infrastructure."

## **ACHIEVEMENT SYSTEM & HONEYCOMB POWER (2:00 - 2:45)**

**[SCREEN: Achievement popup and badge notification]**

"This is where Honeycomb Protocol really shines! When you win your first game, the system automatically checks your achievement criteria and mints a badge on-chain. This 'First Victory' badge is permanently recorded on Solana - no one can take it away or fake it."

**[ACTION: Show achievement popup]**

"The game tracks 8 different achievement types, from simple milestones like 'First Victory' to complex ones like 'Whot Grandmaster' for completing all other badges. Each badge is a real on-chain transaction that proves your accomplishment."

**[ACTION: Show profile with badges]**

"Your profile now shows this achievement permanently. Other players can verify your badges on-chain, creating a trustless reputation system. This is the power of blockchain gaming - real ownership and verifiable achievements."
